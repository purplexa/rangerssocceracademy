# Ranger Life

When we travel as a team, all players should be wearing the same thing.  Preferably, the most visible training gear.  Team sweat jackets should be worn when cold, team rain jackets when raining.

On game days, always pack your home jersey as well as your alternate tops.  Make sure that you have your full kit, cleats, shin guards, socks.  Remember, you are responsible for your gear, not your parents.

Always remember that you are an ambassador of your Rangers team, parents, and club when dressed in your gear… Be polite.  Be respectful.
