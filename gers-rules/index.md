# Rangers: Rules for Games and Practice

Long before Agent Gibbs rules on NCIS there were Rangers Rules.  We are not sure exactly how many there are.  Plus, there always seems to be more each year.  Here are the ones we know of...

- \#1 Eyes are ALWAYS on the ball.

- \#2 Take care of the ball. This means we can dribble, trap, pass, and shoot. All these activities have one common theme – CONTROL

- \#3 No talking while coach is talking.

- \#4 Get to the ball first!!! Winning the ball at the earliest opportunity is a priority. Winning out of the air with headers are a must and a trademark for the way we play.

- \#5 There are no 50/50 balls. Rangers win them all! If you can’t get there first them make an impression – get stuck in. No one on the other team get the ball for free.

- \#6 Talk your team mates up, never tear them down. You win as a team and lose as a team. ALWAYS keep your communication positive.

- \#7 Conduct yourself with class. You always have someone looking at you. Make sure you are doing the right thing all the time.

- \#8 The player on the ball has done his job. It is your responsibility to provide that player with good passing options.

- \#9 BIG goal, LITTLE goalie. Shoot where he isn’t and you will score – aim for the target areas.

- \#10 If you are a midfielder or defender, don’t let the ball go over your head. Win them out of the air!!

- \#11 Check your ego at the door. You play as a team. One player doesn’t make a team win or lose. 

- \#12 ALWAYS show RESPECT to the refs, fans or both teams, your opponent, and all coaches. They are there to have fun just like you.

- \#13 Have fun and smile. It’s a game and games are fun. This will drive your opponents crazy.

- \#21 Always be first to congratulate a team mate when he makes a successful play.

- \#30 NEVER criticize a team mate. Players play – Coaches coach.

- \#49 Treat EVERY practice as a championship. You will only play as well as your practice.

- \#51 Visualize yourself making successful plays and scoring goals.

- \#75 NEVER talk back to the person who washes your uniform and takes you to practice.

- \#77 Be grateful for the opportunity to be a player. It is a privilege that your parents have given to you, not a right. There are many who don’t get the opportunity.

- \#80 Realize that nothing worthwhile comes easy.

- \#99 ALWAYS thank those that help you. Team mates, coaches, teachers, parents and even your brothers and sisters.

# Ranger Uniform/Colors

Wearing your team gear, whether training gear or match kit, is both an honor and a duty. It says more than who you play for – it speaks to where you came from and what it took to get where you are. All the hard work, wins, losses, draws, hours of training, blood, sweat, tears, laughter, and friendships.

Wear your gear proudly. Treat your training gear and uniforms with respect. You worked very hard to earn the right to wear your colors, team badge, and club badge. Be well behaved when you wear your gear. You are representing your team, coaching staff, your club, and your state soccer association when you put on your gear. Someday, you may even have the opportunity to represent your club or country abroad.

Traditionally, Rangers wear blue tops, white shorts, and black socks with red tops. Past Rangers girls have also worn the Rangers Tartan ribbons in their hair for competitions. Alternate colors have varied from orange tops to candy stripes (one of our keeper jerseys). Currently, we will wear our blue tops, black shorts (white when it’s dry – watch for info from the coach or manager), and black w/red socks. You will also need to make sure that you have your alternate tops with you for each game. While we are governed by the club we play for, I try to keep Ranger gear as a part of our team to reflect our Ranger FC heritage.

Some may wonder why we go through the trouble... The underlying tradition and history help the current players understand that they are not the ONLY Rangers. Our team is one of a long line of teams carrying on the name and rich history of teams and players that have come before us. Our boys are carrying on a long tradition of soccer excellence. Putting on the team colors and badge has always been a source of great pride for all those who have been a part of the past teams.

# Ranger Life

When we travel as a team, all players should be wearing the same thing -- preferably, the most visible training gear. Team sweat jackets should be worn when cold, team rain jackets when raining. On game days, always pack your home jersey as well as your alternate tops. Make sure that you have your cleats, shin guards, black & blue socks. Remember, you are responsible for your gear, not your parents.

Always remember that you are an ambassador of your Rangers team, parents, and club when dressed in your team gear... Be polite. Be respectful.
