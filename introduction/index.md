Dear Rangers, Ranger parents, and prospective Rangers,

This information, in this website, used to be in a book, which was handed out to Ranger players and families only.  The ideals that are in here are a foundation for you, as individuals and as a team.  Ideals to build on, to help yourself and your team mates improve.

We will have homework (yes, reading and writing assignments).  We will review John Wooden’s  Pyramid of Success and Rob Kehoe’s Winning Moments (many times) and discuss how they relate to us as individual players and as a team.

I put a very high value on both friendship and loyalty.  Both are essential building blocks to becoming a team.  To me, they are precious commodities.   I hope some of the values, that were instilled into me and the group of Rangers I grew up with, will take root in this new generation of players.

Team camaraderie was bred into me, as a young player, and strengthened by shared experiences.  The coaches I played for all placed a priority on us getting along.  The team that enjoys being together plays better!  This why I try to have everyone spend time together whether through going to the movies, seeing a Pilots game, or even going for ice cream.

As a player, I was trained by a group of coaches that shared a lot of common values.  A very “blue-collar” work ethic was hammered into us.  All the hard training sessions, many long runs, and lengthy road trips bonded us together.  We learned many lessons:  how to practice hard, play hard, to win gracefully, to lose with honor, to work together as a team, to be respectful and polite.  The mutual trust and respect we shared is something I hope these players will develop with their team mates.

 My ultimate hope and goal this year is that we all become better players, a better team, and even better people through the experiences we will share.  I anticipate this will be a great time.  There is a lot of soccer and a lot of fun ahead for us.

Ready!!!!

Go Rangers!!!!
